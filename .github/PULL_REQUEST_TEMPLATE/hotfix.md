## Guidance

A hotfix branch is based off of `master` and is intended to have work
carried out on it, specific to an individual bug.

Once work is completed, two pull requests should be created to merge the
branch into both `master` and `develop` with the merge strategy set to 
`sqush and merge`.

The hotfix branch should then be deleted from the remote.
