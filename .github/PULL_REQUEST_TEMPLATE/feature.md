## Guidance

A feature branch is branched off of `develop` and is intended to have work
carried out on it, specific to an individual feature.

Once work is completed, a pull request should be created to merge the
branch back into `develop` with the merge strategy set to `sqush and merge`.

The feature branch should then be deleted from the remote.
